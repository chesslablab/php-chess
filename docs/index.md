### UCI Engines

Listed below are the UCI engines available at the moment.

- Stockfish

### Object-Oriented

The chess board representation is an object of type [SplObjectStorage](https://www.php.net/manual/en/class.splobjectstorage.php) as opposed to a bitboard.

### Thoroughly Tested

PHP Chess has been developed with a test-driven development (TDD) approach.

The [tests/unit](https://github.com/chesslablab/php-chess/tree/main/tests/unit) folder contains plenty of real examples. Almost every class in the [src](https://github.com/chesslablab/php-chess/tree/main/src) folder represents a concept that is tested accordingly in the [tests/unit](https://github.com/chesslablab/php-chess/tree/main/tests/unit) folder.

The PHP Chess docs are more of a tutorial rather than an API description. The unit tests are the best documentation. For further details on how to use a particular class, please feel free to browse the codebase and check out the corresponding tests.

### Lightweight

PHP dependencies required:

- Rubix ML for machine learning.
- Imagine for image processing.
